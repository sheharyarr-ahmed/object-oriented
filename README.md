# Object-Oriented JavaScript Journey

![Project Screenshot]('imgs/oop.png') <!-- Replace with actual screenshot path if hosting on GitHub or similar -->

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of my expertise in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript**, leveraging modern **ES6+ features** to demonstrate best practices in building scalable, maintainable, and efficient code. As a developer passionate about OOP principles, this project highlights my ability to stand out by applying concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction in real-world JavaScript scenarios. Unlike traditional procedural approaches, this codebase emphasizes prototypal inheritance and class-based structures, making it a prime example of how I elevate my projects with object-oriented design.

Whether you're reviewing my portfolio or exploring OOP in JS, this repo provides hands-on examples that illustrate my mastery of these topics. Each file is self-contained, with console-based outputs for easy testing and learning.

## Key Features and Skills Demonstrated

- **ES6+ Modern JavaScript**: Utilization of classes, arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, and more to write clean, concise code.
- **Core OOP Concepts**:
  - **Constructors and Prototypes**: Building objects with constructor functions and exploring prototypal chains.
  - **Inheritance**: Implementing prototypal inheritance using `Object.create()`, constructor functions, and ES6 classes.
  - **Encapsulation**: Protecting data with closures and private properties (using symbols or WeakMaps where applicable).
  - **Getters and Setters**: Controlling access to object properties for better data integrity.
  - **Static Methods**: Defining utility methods on constructors without instantiation.
  - **Public Interfaces**: Exposing clean APIs while hiding implementation details.
- **Challenges and Practical Examples**: A series of coding challenges that apply OOP to solve problems, simulating real-world applications like modeling entities, hierarchies, and behaviors.
- **Modular Structure**: All scripts are organized in the `js-journey` folder for easy navigation and extension.

This project not only reinforces my object-oriented skills but also showcases how I integrate them with ES6 features to create code that's readable, reusable, and performant—setting me apart from developers who rely on outdated or non-OOP patterns.

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized as follows:

- **`js-journey/`**: Contains all the core JavaScript files demonstrating OOP concepts.
  - `challenge-1.js`: Basic object creation and manipulation challenges.
  - `challenge-2.js`: Intermediate inheritance exercises.
  - `challenge-3.js`: Advanced polymorphism scenarios.
  - `challenge-4.js`: Real-world application challenges combining multiple OOP principles.
  - `constructor-function.js`: Introduction to constructor functions.
  - `constructor-prototypal-inheritance.js`: Deep dive into prototypal inheritance via constructors.
  - `encapsulation.js`: Techniques for data hiding and encapsulation.
  - `es6-classes-prototypal-inheritance.js`: ES6 classes with inheritance.
  - `es6-classes.js`: Fundamentals of ES6 classes.
  - `getters-setters.js`: Using getters and setters for property control.
  - `object-create-prototypal-inheritance.js`: Inheritance using `Object.create()`.
  - `object-create.js`: Manual object creation with prototypes.
  - `prototype.js`: Exploring the prototype chain.
  - `public-interface.js`: Designing public APIs for objects.
  - `static-methods.js`: Implementing static methods on classes/constructors.
- **`index.html`**: A simple HTML file to run scripts in the browser (uncomment script tags as needed).
- **`script.js`**: Optional main script for custom executions.
- **`.prettierrc`**: Configuration for code formatting to ensure consistency.
- **`README.md`**: This file—your guide to the project.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-oriented-js.git
   cd object-oriented-js
   ```

2. **Open in Your Editor**:

   - Use VS Code or any editor (as shown in the screenshot for reference).

3. **Run Individual Scripts**:

   - For browser execution:
     - Open `index.html` in your browser.
     - Uncomment the relevant `<script>` tag in `index.html` for the file you want to test (e.g., `<script src="js-journey/challenge-1.js"></script>`).
     - Open the browser console (F12) to view outputs.
   - For Node.js execution:
     - Navigate to the file: `node js-journey/challenge-1.js`.
     - Most files use `console.log()` for output.

4. **Dependencies**:
   - No external dependencies required—just vanilla JavaScript!
   - Ensure your environment supports ES6 (modern browsers or Node.js v6+).

## Why This Project Stands Out

In a sea of JavaScript developers, my focus on object-oriented practices allows me to architect code that's not just functional but also elegant and extensible. This repo is a testament to that, covering everything from basic prototypes to advanced ES6 class inheritance. It's designed to be a learning resource as well as a portfolio highlight, proving my ability to tackle complex problems with structured, OOP-driven solutions.

If you're hiring or collaborating, this codebase exemplifies how I bring precision and innovation to every project.
